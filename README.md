This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for training and evaluating a neural network on the Cats vs Dogs dataset. This dataset consists of images of cats and dogs, used for binary classification tasks.

<h1><b><u>Overview</u></b></h1>
The notebook includes the following sections:
<br>
<b>Data Loading and Preprocessing: </b>Loading the dataset, augmenting, and normalizing the images.<br>
<b>Model Building: </b>Constructing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.<br>
<b>Training: </b>Training the CNN on the training dataset.<br>
<b>Evaluation: </b>Assessing the performance of the model on the test dataset.<br>
<b>Visualization:</b> Visualizing the training process, data augmentation, and the results.
<h1><b><u>Getting Started</u></b></h1>
To run the notebook, you can open it in Google Colab by clicking the "Open in Colab" badge above. Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run the notebook locally if you have Jupyter installed.

<h1><b><u>Requirements</u></b></h1>
1.Python 3.x<br>
2.Jupyter Notebook<br>
3.TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the implementation in the notebook)<br>
4.NumPy<br>
5.Matplotlib<br>
6.PIL (Python Imaging Library)
